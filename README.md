# stock-analysis
Overview of Project
This project is to use a sample of stock dataset for years 2017 and 2018 and to run VBA script that is written in a certain form and then re-factored to improve the efficiency of code writing.

Results
Using a bit of object oriented design will improve effieciency in reusability and allow the program to be able to allow for a program to be extensible.  Even though using certain data structures like arrays may improve the effeciency of code, sometimes, setting certain arrays  or downloading certian datasets will improve the runtime of a code set.

Summary
In conclusion, having the an array to determing a certain dataset amongst a number of rows will increase the time of effieciency and runtime.  It is better to have a determined dataset upfront and just a singleton variable to increase the runtime.
